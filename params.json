  "body": "# Atom-file-icons-for-browser\r\nModification of DanBrooker's(@DanBrooker) [file-icons](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) Atom package to work in browser.\r\n\r\nIncludes stylings/icons for .file-text-o and .folder-open for file and folder icons respectively as well as default \"?\" icon for icons either improperly called or not in file-icons.less.\r\n\r\nAlso includes alternate font formats for some fonts.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFirst steps:\r\n  1. Download or clone this repo\r\n  2. Use [less.js](http://lesscss.org/) either by `npm install -g less` or by including less from their CDN\r\n  ```\r\n  <script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/2.7.1/less.min.js\"></script>\r\n  ```\r\n  3. Import file-icons.less in your browser from whichever directory you have configured for serving files like so:\r\n  ```\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet/less\" href=\"/stylesheets/file-icons.less\">\r\n  ```\r\n  This should import the other relevant .less files as well as define the font faces available.\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nJust define the attribute data-name=\"\" inside of any HTML tag with the file extension, and the relevant icon should be placed ```less :before ``` the tag.\r\nExample:\r\n```html\r\n<span data-name=\".atom\"></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for all icons in the examples directory of Atom file-icons which can be found here: [file-icons/example](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n\r\n## TO DO:\r\n\r\n1. Include complete set of icons from Octicons, and other fonts.\r\n2. Get color/black & white toggling working\r\n3. MOAR ICONS!!!!!!!!\r\n",
